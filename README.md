### README: Live PUBG Tournament Scoreboard

This document provides instructions for running the live scoreboard script and setting up the overlays for a PUBG tournament.

***

### 1. How to Run the Script

The Python script (`live_monitor.py`) is designed to parse live log files, calculate tournament standings, and generate a JSON file that your web overlays can read.

1.  **Save the provided Python script** as `live_monitor.py`.
2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt** in the directory where you saved the script.
3.  **Run the script** with the command:
    ```bash
    python live_scoreboard.py
    ```
4.  The script will start monitoring for new log files and will continuously update the `live_scoreboard.json` file. Keep this terminal window open during the tournament.

### 2. Log File Setup

The script requires access to a live log file generated by the tournament client.

* **Placement:** Place the log file in the **`logs/current/`** directory. If this directory doesn't exist, the script will create it.
* **Dynamic Source:** The script is set up to automatically find and start monitoring a new log file if one appears in the `logs/current/` directory after the previous match has ended.

### 3. Setting Up the Overlays

The HTML files (`overall-standings.html`, `match-standings.html`, etc.) are designed to be used as a "browser source" in streaming software like OBS Studio.

1.  **Start the Web Server:** Before using the overlays, you must have a local web server running to host the HTML files and the `live_scoreboard.json` data. The provided Python script `webserver.py` is assumed to do this.
2.  **Add a Browser Source:** In your streaming software, add a new source and select **Browser**.
3.  **Enter the Local URL:** Set the URL to the location of your HTML file on the local server. The URLs will be similar to these:
    * `http://localhost:5000/overlays/overall-standings.html`
    * `http://localhost:5000/overlays/match-standings.html`
4.  **Adjust Size:** Set the width and height of the browser source to match your canvas size (e.g., 1920x1080).
5.  **Test and Verify:** Run the script and open the HTML file in a web browser directly to verify that data is being populated. It is highly recommended to compare the data on the overlays with the known official standings to ensure everything is working as expected before going live.

### 4. Dynamic Team Logos

The script's rendering logic dynamically links to team logos.

* **Logo Naming:** The script assumes your logo files are named according to the team's name and are located in the **`assets/`** directory (e.g., `TeamLiquid.png`, `FaZeClan.png`).
* **Fallback:** If a team's logo is not found, the overlay will automatically display the `default-team-logo.jpg` image. Place this image in the `assets/` folder as a fallback.
* **Path:** The URLs in the HTML templates are set up to fetch these assets from `http://localhost:5000/assets/`. You will need to make sure your logo files are available at this path.
